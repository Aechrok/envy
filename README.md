  -h, --help                  Show this message and exit.
  ```

## Environment Setup
#### Azure
To avoid the dreaded "God Account", a minimum of two Service Principals are required: One to access the Key Vault to retrieve the environment secret, and the second with write permissions to make the desired changes.

#### Key Vault
Environments are stored as a single JSON object within a keyvault secret

```json
{
    "ARM_TENANT_ID":"XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "ARM_CLIENT_ID":"XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "ARM_CLIENT_SECRET":"XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```

#### CI/CD
However you choose to do it, five(5) environmental variables are required to run ENVy: `AZURE_SECRET_NAME`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AZURE_KEYVAULT_NAME`. These can be injected as a Kubernetes secret, or otherwise pushed into the environment that is running ENVy.

If you are using tools such as [Atlantis](https://www.runatlantis.io/) where the repository name is provided as a variable at runtime, it is preferable to name the keyvault secret the same as the repository so that you can run workflows such as:

```shell
envy -n $BASE_REPO_NAME -c 'terraform init'
```

This allows for multi-tenant use with Azure without exposing the credentials for the Service Principals with access.

## Features
#### Masking
Masking is supported to hide a variable from the child command. Adding a `-m` or `--mask` switch with the matching variable name will achieve this.

```shell
envy -n ... --mask VARIABLE -c 'child process'
```
